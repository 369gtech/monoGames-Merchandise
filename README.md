<h1>monoGames-Merchandise</h1>
<p>
Each <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Factions">Faction</a> within monoGames will have an opportunity to own a Merchandise Shop in a partnership with monoGames for the sales of retail products. All proceeds would go back into promoting the game and how each Faction does that will be up to that community to vote on. This is one of many revenue streams we want to give Factions to sustainably promote players to joining our game.
